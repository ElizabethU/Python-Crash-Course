###Python Style Rules
#####Semicolons

? Do not terminate your lines with semi-colons and do not use semi-colons to put
two commands on the same line.

#####Line length

? Maximum line length is 80 characters.

#####Parentheses

? Use parentheses sparingly.

#####Indentation

? Indent your code blocks with 4 spaces.

#####Blank Lines

? Two blank lines between top-level definitions, one blank line between method
definitions.

#####Whitespace

? Follow standard typographic rules for the use of spaces around punctuation.

#####Comments

? Be sure to use the right style for module, function, method and in-line comments.

#####Classes

? If a class inherits from no other base classes, explicitly inherit from object. 

This also applies to nested classes.

#####Strings

? Use the % operator for formatting strings, even when the parameters are all
strings. 

Use your best judgement to decide between + and % though.

#####TODO Comments

? Use TODO comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution,
or good-enough but not perfect.

#####Imports formatting

? Imports should be on separate lines.

#####Statements

? Generally only one statement per line.

#####Naming

? module_name, package_name, ClassName, method_name, ExceptionName,
function_name, GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME, global_var_name, 
instance_var_name, function_parameter_name, local_var_name.
