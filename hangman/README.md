Hangman
=======

Before you is python file with a game of Hangman... but wait! This just looks like Ruby? It is Ruby. This file doesn't run without hella errors. 

For the first few months writing Python is going to be like writing a weird Ruby where syntax is a little different, but the same overall strategies mostly work, and a lot of the syntax does too. So, the best thing we can do for you is to give you experience with what kind of errors Python will throw when you inevitably write some Ruby code into your file, and give you a lot of experience with what doesn't work anymore, and identifying and fixing errors.

You're also going to read a lot of other people's code in your internships. This is practice at that.

####Your goal: 
Going through the errors you recieve, fix this file until it's written in Python.
